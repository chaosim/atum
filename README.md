# Atum - Functional Javascript Interpreter in Javascript #

## About ##
Atum is a Javascript interpreter written in functional style Javascript. 

Atum's functional implementation differentiates it from existing Javascript self
interpreters such as Narcissus. Additionally, Atum aims to provide a high degree
of modularity and flexibility to allow experimentation.

Project Goals:

* Functional style implementation.
* Modular code structure.
* Minimal direct reliance on host language features.


## Modules ##

### semantics 'atum/semantics' ###
Defines computations for the semantics of an ECMAScript program. 

### value 'atum/value' ###
Defines primitive value data structures and operations.

### context 'atum/context' ###
Defines data structures and operations for working with ECMAScript execution
contexts.

## TODO
Atum is far from complete and currently only has very basic functionality.
Major todo tasks include:

* Builtins
* Arguments object
* Array objects
* Arguments object
* Labels
* Exceptions
* Try catch
* With
* in operator
* instanceof operator
* Inheritance
* Memory management
* and much more ...
